# py_folder_organizer
Organizes files inside a folder into categories( Images, Videos, Documents, SRCS ....)

## How to ?
- To use it just lunch the script from the folder that you want to clean  

to be able to call it anywhere from the terminal (Linux):
- make this file executable with `$ chmod +x ./fileOrganizer.py`
- `$ sudo cp ./fileOrganizer.py /usr/local/bin/orgf`
- call `$ orgf` in any dir you want to clean it except for critical dirs such as Home folder  




#### TODO:
- support multiple dirs via arguments
- prompt the user to overwrite files or rename
